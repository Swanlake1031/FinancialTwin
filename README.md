🔮 Financial Twin: AI-Powered Spending Forecast & Optimization
This project builds a financial behavior simulation system that helps users visualize, understand, and optimize their personal spending habits.

Using a sequence-to-sequence LSTM model with attention, we forecast future spending patterns across subcategories (e.g., takeout, rent, utilities) based on historical bank transactions. By integrating Gemini's language model for semantic classification and real + synthetic transaction data, the system can:

🔍 Analyze monthly categorized spending

📈 Predict future expenditures over 6 months

💰 Simulate personalized saving strategies

🧠 Highlight key reduction areas (e.g. “cut back on takeout”)

This project bridges LLMs, time-series modeling, and personal finance analytics — with a goal to empower individuals to build better financial habits through intelligent forecasting and gamified planning.
